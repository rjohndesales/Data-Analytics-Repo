## Machine Learning AI Project Notebook:

# Background:
- Classic Titanic data science exploration

# Project Parameters:
- Make a model to predict who will survive and who will not

# Datasets:
- 1 training dataset
- 1 test dataset

# Tools used:
- MS Azure Sagemaker
- Jupyter Lab Environment

# Special Features:
- Numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
- Logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, Linear SVM, RBH SVM, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Naive Bayes

# Analytical Significance:
- Vectorization speeds up process time
- Females and passenger class 1 more likely to survive
