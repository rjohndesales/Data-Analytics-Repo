## Database Analysis using Python data frames:

# Background:
- This project was completed in the Business Analytics capstone course of my DeSales MSBA program
- Interested in the healthcare field, wanted to explorting machine learning prediction

# Project Parameters:
- Create a signature project using Python and a Jupyter Notebook
- Main Questions: Can we accurately predict whether a patient will have heart disease?
- What are the strongest features?
- Does the prediction change between men and women?

# Datasets:
- 2023 BRFSS survey found here: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html
- 24 features and 1 binary target variable

# Tools used:
- Jupyter Notebook environment
- Python

# Special Features:
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

# Analytical Significance:
- Random Forest Classifier was the best model for overall, male, and female models
- The best model was at least 94% for each model
- Age and BMI were the most significant features
