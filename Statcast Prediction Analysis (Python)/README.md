## Database Analysis using Python data frames:

# Background:
- I am a huge baseball fan, part of what drove me to analytics
- Baseball Savant is a website and database that utilizes statcast data
- Statcast is a state of the art tracking technology that can measure new aspects of baseball
- Statcast uses high-resolution cameras to capture movement and location
- This data is then used to create new statistics

# Project Parameters:
- Tasked with using python querying to investigate and visual datasets
- Main question: How accurately do Statcast metrics measure actual performance?

# Datasets:
- 2 custom datasets from BaseballSavant.com using filters
- 1 joined dataset (statcast data with age)

# Tools used:
- Google Colaboratory (Jupyter Notebook environment)
- Python
- Statcast

# Special Features:
- Various graphs/charts showing different trends and statistics

# Analytical Significance:
- Mixed results
- Hard-hit rate, xba, and xslg predicted well
- Launch Angle, Sprint Speed, and Exit Velocity not as well
- Future work on comparison of different defensive metrics would be interesting
