## Data Mining SAS Project:

# Background:
- Analyzing SBA (small business administration) loans data
- SBA is an organization founded in 1953 to aid small businesses in the U.S.

# Project Parameters:
- Presenting business related findings from a public dataset
- Question of what factors impact whether or not a loan is paid back?

# Datasets:
- SBA Loans from Kaggle.com

# Tools used:
- SAS Enterprise Miner

# Special Features:
- Used 4 different analyses: neural network, ward cluster, decision tree, and logistic regression

# Analytical Significance:
- Target variable of MIS_Status (whether the loan was paid in full or charged off)
- Within the Neural Network, the larger the loan amount, the greater the chance of paying the loan in full
- Within the Decision Tree, the Term of the loan had the highest variable importance when predicting MIS_Status
- Term and the gross amount approved of the loan were strongest predictors of MIS_Status
